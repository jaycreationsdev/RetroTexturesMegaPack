# RetroTexturesMegaPack
The Retro Texture Mega Pack currently includes 232 material instances for extremely easy drag and drop texturing while you build levels for your retro game. These materials are all seamless materials that can be tiled infinitely and have a great amount of detail. They're all also 256x256 textures, making them quick to import and work with.

    Each material includes its respective Base Color, Normal, Height, Roughness, and Metallic maps. (Note: some materials don't include every map as some don't need them.) If you're making a game inspired by older games, you do not need to use these additional maps and they are turned OFF by default. Changing the master material will allow you to easily change this if you want them on.
    Vertex painting on the red channel is also set up and ready to use, with the flexibility to add more channels easily.
    These materials can be easily used for mobile projects.
    By default, each texture is filtered by Nearest and has NO mipmap generation. You can easily change this if you'd like by using the Bulk Editor inside of Unreal.
    World Aligned Texture UVs are ready to use.
